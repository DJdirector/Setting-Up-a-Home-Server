## Requirements

Now, to make a project, you obviously need resources that you will use to create said project.
But some people might not want to buy a full blown computer, and try to re-use that old PC thats clogging up space in the closet or basement.
And thats fine! In fact, I actually highly recomend that you do this to get atleast familiar with home servers, and get that nice feeling
that you actually did something about that previously considered E-Waste. And hey! you probably paid good money back in the day,
so why not repurpose it? If you use a Work stacion or a laptop often or just for work, most requirements you might allready have.
### Needed
- Old PC or a PC in General
- Another PC to flash the ISO Image and to remotely controll old PC
- Keyboard that uses USB
- Monitor
- A USB Thumbdrive with ATLEAST 8 GB of storage.
- An Ethernet Cable
- And a place to put the PC thats relativly close or right next to your modem or router.
- alot of Patience

  ## Choosing the right OS

  Now, if you use a work stacion or a laptop daily, then you have to atleast heard or used Windows on said devices,
  As Windows comes with many laptops or mini PC preinstalled from the factory. Now, if you use Apple Devices, such as the Macbook Air, IPhone, or IWatch,
  you will atleast be familiar with MacOS for MacBooks, IOS for Iphones, and whatever runs on the IWatch. Both Windows and MacOS are operating systems designed to work
  on said hardware. but did you know that there is actually a third Operating system, mostly overshadowed until recently? Linux! Linux is a UNIX based operating system like MacOS,
  and Dominates the charts when it comes to how many servers use it. It is highly customizable, and comes with a vast community developing Open Source software for it.
  As per this tutorial, we shall be using Linux for the OS of the device. Now, dont worry, a whole other operaing system does sound a little scary for you new users out there.
  but ill try to be as helpfull as can be to explain the process to you. In this tutorial, we shall be using a server instalacion, designed specifically for servers and service
  providers.
